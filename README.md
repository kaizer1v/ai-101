## Supervised
Supervised learning is when the information / data fed to be trained is labelled i.e. The human is manually labelling this and then this labelled data is used to train a model. There are different categories of models in supervised learning

> Supervised learning algorithms learn to predict x -> y mappings or input to output mappings.

#### 1. Classifier models
These are models that output a 'yes' or a 'no'. Can be reffered to as binary classification. Eg: 'Spam' or 'not Spam'. These are discrete class labels.

Advanced classifier models can also classify into more than 2 buckets, not just binary.

Example algorithms
* Decision trees
* Vector machines - Random forests
* SVMs

#### 2. Regression models

Common types of models
1. Linear regression - outputs a probability of something. eg: prediction of a stock price value, along with a probability
2. Logistic regression -

## Unsupervised
Here the data provided isn't labelled. The model automatically discovers patterns. This type of models are used when you want to cluster data into different auto-defined buckets (not pre-defined)
