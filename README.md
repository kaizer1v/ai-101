# AI 101

**Goal**
The goal is to get a primer on Machine Learning before I deep dive into understanding and practically use LLMs and build something with AI. The idea is to become familiar with the foundations and basics of AI - thus, machine learning - the very basics of how it works. The idea is also to learn how to model something programatically.

## Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning

## Supervised
Supervised learning is when the information / data fed to be trained is labelled i.e. The human is manually labelling this and then this labelled data is used to train a model. There are different categories of models in supervised learning

> Supervised learning algorithms learn to predict x -> y mappings or input to output mappings.

#### 1. Classifier models
These are models that output a 'yes' or a 'no'. Can be reffered to as binary classification. Eg: 'Spam' or 'not Spam'. These are discrete class labels.

Advanced classifier models can also classify into more than 2 buckets, not just binary.

Example algorithms
* Decision trees
* Vector machines - Random forests
* SVMs

#### 2. Regression models

Common types of models
1. Linear regression - outputs a probability of something. eg: prediction of a stock price value, along with a probability
2. Logistic regression -




## Unsupervised
Here the data provided isn't labelled. The model automatically discovers patterns. This type of models are used when you want to cluster data into different auto-defined buckets (not pre-defined)

## Regression Model

This is a supervised machine learning model, where the training dataset contains the answers as well as the parameters (supervised). Thus, the model will generate a function that will take a new value (test data) as an input and try to provide an output. **Linear Regression** particularly, means the function is a type of linear equation or a line. There are other models that are non-linear in nature as well, where they would generate a non-linear equation. The output generated by a linear regression model would be a specific numeric value. There are other categorical predictions made by classification models as well, where the output is a probability of likliness of a finite set of specific class.

There are also single variable versus multi variable linear regression models. The single variable refers to the single value provided as input (`x`).

Any input to the model is usually denoted by `x` or also called as `feature` or `input` and the output is denoted by `y`

## Cost Functions

The cost function is the main function that will help generate the model. Think of this as the unit test-case for any function, that contains the cases that is required to test the model.

## Training

The training actually occurs in the automation of the algorithm that continuously searches for the most optimum values `w` and `b` such that the cost is almost `0`. The algorithm used here is the **gradient descent**.
