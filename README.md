**Supervised** learning is when the information / data fed to be trained is labelled i.e. The human is manually labelling this and then this labelled data is used to train a model. There are different categories of models in supervised learning

#### 1. Classifier models
These are models that output a 'yes' or a 'no'. Can be reffered to as binary classification. Eg: 'Spam' or 'not Spam'. These are discrete class labels.

Advanced classifier models can also classify into more than 2 buckets, not just binary.
